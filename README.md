# Kostenstellenrechnung (cost center accounting)

15/15 points

ok so basically this is a german slideshow + handout made in like 3h prepared
with one markdown file that converts to both latex article (handout) and beamer
(slideshow).

basically just trying out whether using beamer for slideshows is worth it or
not. i also didnt bother with bibliography lmao.

a bash script that automatically updates the pdf files is included. pandoc and
latex are required to run it.
